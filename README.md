# What's included?
Currently a minimal front end created with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). 
The backend was created with header, code and footer layouts (so I don't have to repeat every step when creating a page)

# Available pages
* Actions/Index - A list of the available operations
* Error - If any error occurs (With custom messages for 4xx and 5xx errors)
* Get - an interactive example to list the users in the (local) database.
* Post - an interactive example to create a new user

# To do
- [ ] Add update operation
- [ ] Add delete operation
- [ ] When using shift+click (or shift+enter in search form) in any url and the target has ability to show a json response, show as iframe the json response

# Warning
THIS IS NOT A FUNCTIONING NOR SUPPORTED APPLICATION. IS JUST TO SHOW SOME OF MY WORK AND EXPERIENCE.
